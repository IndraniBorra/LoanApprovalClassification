###Project Type : 
Take a specific problem, pose it as a machine
learning problem (classification, regression, clustering, ..),
train a ML model and study its performance.

###Project implementation would have the following characteristics:
• Pick the dataset from a good online source.
• A good study of the characteristics and properties of the
dataset.
• A decent amount of introductory data analysis done
(correlations, label and feature distributions, missing values,
imbalance, mean/variance of features, etc.)
• A comprehensive evaluation of different ML algorithms
(linear models, decision trees, boosted trees and random
forests, neural networks, etc.)
• Use of meaningful evaluation metrics
• An analysis of what works and what does not work
• Lessons Learnt from the Project and How the project helped
you.
